# EXPLORATION 1

## Group members: Natalia Mora, Daniel Yowell

### Honors research (CS3980-023), Dr. Richard Veras, Spring 2023

#### Objective: Build a working tic-tac-toe program which can later be optimized with reinforcement learning techniques.

#### Instructions:

- `main.py` runs the entire program.
- `state.py` relies solely on prewritten .txt files. The rest rely on .txt files generated by other .py files.
- Before running `main.py`, `calc-reward-output.txt` should always be in this format (where `X` = # of player wins):

> The player has won:  
> X  
> times
